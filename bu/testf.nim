    return 0
  cpath.setLen nPath    # `vip` does not open any files post `parseIn()`

#[ To cursor down, `vip` must test one at a time until a success.  To get more
async/scalable needs a batch interface with forked kids which an ok idea since a
hanging NFS mount can hang a kid process & we might want to kill it.  Laziness
of outer validation may mean only 0..3 timeouts in any given UI interaction.
So, they could be made 50..100ms.  There may be a way to build a critbit tree,
monitor /proc/mounts, and only time out once per mount prefix or etc.  Of
course, a file system could also come back online at any moment as well.

On systems with nice enough terminal interaction for `vip` to make sense but
poor dynamically loadable lib support (are there any??), `vip` *could* add a
`--validation-coprocess=foo` to make a kid process to delegate requests to,
mostly blocked on IPC read, but ready to read a path, do whatever user-program
tests & write 1-byte.  While 2 syscalls per request (in both parent & kid +
whatever validation work), they are at least fast-ish pipe-IO calls.

This module could grow a large family of `bu/ft`-like tests.  PRs welcome if
this would help your specific application setting. ]#
